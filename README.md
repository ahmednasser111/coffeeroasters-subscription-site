## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM methodology
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript + modules

### Continued development

In hindsight, I can see how not utilising a framework would make this multi-page websites difficult to maintain and update.

I will now be focusing on learning JS frameworks.
